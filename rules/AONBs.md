## 🌳 **Strict Controls in Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs)**

**AONBs** aren’t just scenic designations — they carry **planning constraints**:

### 🛡️ A — Additional Planning Controls

Properties in AONBs (and similar protected land like National Parks, Conservation Areas) lose some **Permitted Development Rights** — meaning many small buildings or extensions **require full planning permission** where they wouldn’t elsewhere. ([VESP Architects][1])

Example from GOV.UK technical guidance:

* On AONB/Article 2(3) land, *buildings/infrastructure more than 20 m from the original house that would otherwise be permitted are restricted to total ground coverage ≤10 m²* unless permission is granted. ([GOV.UK][2])

### 🏡 B — Why These Restrictions Exist

The goal is to **protect landscape character and visual amenity** and avoid incremental creep of built form into sensitive countryside — hence the relatively tighter development envelope.
